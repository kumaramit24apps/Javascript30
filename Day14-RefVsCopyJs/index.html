    // now here is the problem!

    // oh no - we have edited the original array too!

    // Why? It's because that is an array reference, not an array copy. They both point to the same array!
    
    //creating copy of the original array
    
    //method 01. 
    // So, how do we fix this? We take a copy instead!
    const team2 = players.slice();

    //method 02. 
    // or create a new array and concat the old one in
    const team3 = [].concat(players)

     
    // method 03.  
    // or use the new ES6 Spread
    const team4 = [...players]; 
    

    // now when we update it, the original one isn't changed
    team4['3'] = 'Amit Kumar'

    // with Objects
    const person = {
      name: 'Wes Bos',
      age: 80
    };

    // and think we make a copy:
    // const captain = person
    //we're not making a copy instead we're passing the reference object
    // captain.numers = 99; 


    // how do we take a copy instead?
    // method 01. 
    const cap2 = Object.assign({}, person, {number: 99, age: 12});

    const cap3 = {...person};
    console.log(cap3);
    cap3.age = 32;

    // Things to note - this is only 1 level deep - both for Arrays and Objects. lodash has a cloneDeep method, but you should think twice before using it.
